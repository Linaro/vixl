class TestPoolManager;

// There are four classes declared in this header file:
// PoolManager, PoolObject, ForwardReference and LocationBase.

// The PoolManager manages both literal and veneer pools, and is designed to be
// shared between AArch32 and AArch64. A pool is represented as an abstract
// collection of references to objects. The manager does not need to know
// architecture-specific details about literals and veneers; the actual
// emission of the pool objects is delegated.
//
// Literal and Label will derive from LocationBase. The MacroAssembler will
// create these objects as instructions that reference pool objects are
// encountered, and ask the PoolManager to track them. The PoolManager will
// create an internal PoolObject object for each object derived from
// LocationBase.  Some of these PoolObject objects will be deleted when placed
// (e.g. the ones corresponding to Literals), whereas others will be updated
// with a new range when placed (e.g.  Veneers) and deleted when Bind() is
// called on the PoolManager with their corresponding object as a parameter.
//
// A ForwardReference represents a reference to a PoolObject that will be
// placed later in the instruction stream. Each ForwardReference may only refer
// to one PoolObject, but many ForwardReferences may refer to the same
// object.
//
// A PoolObject represents an object that has not yet been placed.  The final
// location of a PoolObject (and hence the LocationBase object to which it
// corresponds) is constrained mostly by the instructions that refer to it, but
// PoolObjects can also have inherent constraints, such as alignment.
//
// LocationBase objects, unlike PoolObject objects, can be used outside of the
// pool manager (e.g. as manually placed literals, which may still have
// forward references that need to be resolved).
//
// At the moment, each LocationBase will have at most one PoolObject that keeps
// the relevant information for placing this object in the pool. When that
// object is placed, all forward references of the object are resolved. For
// that reason, we do not need to keep track of the ForwardReference objects in
// the PoolObject.

// T is an integral type used for representing locations. For a 32-bit
// architecture it will typically be int32_t, whereas for a 64-bit
// architecture it will be int64_t.
